title: TrueNas Scale 🖥 22.02.4 upgrade and Docker 🐳 migration
---

For quite a long time, I was running on TrueNas Scale [22.02.0.1](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scalereleasenotes/#220201).
However, I noticed in the release notes of the next version ([22.02.1](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scalereleasenotes/#22021)), that the `docker-compose` binary would get disabled.
Specifically, the changes in [NAS-115010](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-115010).
However, my entire Docker 🐳 setup is based on it.
Like [Ixian](https://www.truenas.com/community/members/ixian.49707/) already said on the TrueNas form (🔗 [link](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/docker-containers-have-no-outbound-internet-connectivity.91148/post-675390)), I don't really want to learn about Kubernetes and Ingress.
In particular, because I am pretty happy with my Traefik-managed "ingress" variant.

So I will ride the train 🚝 (TrueNas Scale that is) as long as possible (because they consider dropping `docker` altogether 😱).
Back to the problem at hand:
the host `docker-compose` binary is destined to be inaccessible or removed during the update I planned.
Josh suggested in the TrueNas forum to use the TrueCharts provided Docker compose app to boot-strap a `docker-compose` based setup (🔗 [link](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/truecharts-integrates-docker-compose-with-truenas-scale.99848/)).
I tried that, without success though.
Sadly, _Apps_ have very poor logging and debuggabilty in general.

I then thought 🤔💭:
maybe there is a Docker 🐳 container through which I can launch `docker-compose`.
After all, Portainer is able to run `docker-compose` and launch it into the connected docker socket.
I found that Docker themselves even provide such a container: [`docker/compose`](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/compose).
However, there were two things I didn't like:
1. The entrypoint script was confusing (weird conditions) and not documented
2. If I mount a `docker-compose.yml` file and deploy the stack, the stack name will be of the parent folder and all host-related paths (`.env` files or volume mounts) wouldn't be found.
   The stack name could easily be overwritten with the [`-p`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/#use--p-to-specify-a-project-name) option.
   However, the relative / absolute path problem remained.

Eventually, I decided to build my own `compose` image and publish it on [`patzm/compose`](https://hub.docker.com/r/patzm/compose) 🎉 🤗.
I employ a trick (obviously propose by someone on the web 🌐) to mirror the host environment.
This trick is, for instance, also used in my Portainer stack:
<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpatzm%2Fdockerfiles%2Fblob%2Fc49536dd5831f4f95b2528bd6750f0f6be75da54%2Fportainer%2Fdocker-compose.yml%23L11&style=monokai-sublime&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>
instead of simply mounting it to `/data`.
I need to tell Portainer then where to store (and find) stack information though with the `--data` argument:
<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpatzm%2Fdockerfiles%2Fblob%2Fc49536dd5831f4f95b2528bd6750f0f6be75da54%2Fportainer%2Fdocker-compose.yml%23L6&style=monokai-sublime&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>
This approach has two benefits:
1. The `docker-compose.yml`'s parent folder is exactly the same as it is outside of the container and thus the stack name won't be changed.
2. All environment files (e.g. `.env`) and volume mounts of the host file system work ✅.

One can then very easily launch a stack:
```bash
cd to/my/stack-folder
docker run -it --rm \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
    patzm/compose \
    $(pwd) up -d
```

The `-e` flags can be used to pass additional environment variables.

I then performed the upgrade, boot-strapped 🥾 my essential stacks again (Traefik, Portainer, and authentication), and then used the Portainer service to deploy the rest directly from GitHub.
Sadly, I could not get rid of overwriting the default TrueNas Scale `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file with the following:
```json
{
    "data-root": "/mnt/ssd-1tb/docker-standalone",
    "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=cgroupfs"],
    "iptables": true,
    "bridge": "",
    "dns": ["192.168.178.1"]
}
```
In particular, `iptables` still needs to be enabled.
