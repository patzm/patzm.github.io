title: "Crawling contact pictures 👤"
---

Humans are visual 👀 beings.
And me personally maybe even more than the average (I love emoji 🙈).
So naturally, working with a contacts / address book 📔 like this:
![contacts-no-pictures]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25/contacts-no-pictures.png){:height="250px"}

isn't very appealing to me.
Now of course, I can go about an over time manually add pictures.
But I have 400+ contacts in my address book.
That wouldn't scale 😞.

Soooo 💡: let's find them on the web 🌐.
Let's program ⌨️ something 🎉🙌.

Long story short: check out [patzm/contacts-updater](https://github.com/patzm/contacts-updater) on GitHub.
A tiny Python-based command line tool for macOS 🍏.
It has multiple profile picture providers, which I might extend over time.
Also, open source collaborators are always welcome 🤗.

With this tool, I managed to find profile pictures for roughly **50%** of my contacts 🚀.
And I can re-run it whenever I want.
No API rate limitations.

Now, my address book looks much more colorful 🧡💙💚💜❤️
